Rna-seq Proyect,"Clavulanic acid is a β-lactamase inhibitor, and is produced industrially by fermentative processes, using the bacterium Streptomyces clavuligerus. The efficiency of CA production is associated with media composition, culture conditions and the physiological and genetic characteristics of the strain. However, much of the molecular pathways governing AC regulation in S. clavuligerus remain unknown, and despite numerous studies, the regulatory mechanisms involved in the AC biosynthesis pathway have not yet been fully identified. In this work, a transcriptomic analysis was performed using RNA-seq data from S. clavuligerus strain ATCC 27064 which was grown in two culture media. The first was a complex, soy-based medium which was rich in nutrients. The second medium was a chemically defined, nutrient-poor medium. In total 1505 genes were found to be differentially expressed, 587 genes were expressed under the favourable conditions of soybean cultivation and 918 under unfavourable cultivation conditions. In addition, the string tool, available in cytoscape, was used to construct an interaction network with the data obtained in the differential expression analysis, using a confidentiality score of 0.7. An enrichment analysis was performed using string to identify which of these genes were involved in the production of antibiotics and other synthesis processes of interest, such as arginine production. We used the cluster Maker 2 tool and found a group of differentially expressed genes that contribute to the production of alanine which is an important precursor for the production of clavulanic acid. Transcriptome analysis in S. clavuligerus contributes to the identification of transcript abundance during cell development and environmental perturbations, which helps us to understand how the microorganism behaves under various conditions and thus contribute to the understanding of how clavulanic acid production functions.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N4XROLoKU945bgPoL6i7s-1T9KSi2Msm/view?usp=sharing

For pRESTO MaskPrimers with R2 primer fasta, change max error rate from 0.2 to 0.5 to match the output of PrestoV5.3_AbSeqV3_html.sh more closely (this should increase the output size). v3.1.6: Try to make pRESTO CollapseSeq fastq output size match that obtained using PrestoV5.3_AbSeqV3_html.sh on the command line. Add workflow parameter Minimum Quality to pRESTO FilterSeq tool after pRESTO AssemblePairs. v3.1.7: Flips sense of the final partition to display those with 2 or more not 2 or less, reverts Min qual filter param (it only needs to be changed for debugging) v3.1.8: Adds second MiGMAP tool to produce both IG and TCR reports (it can't run both at once), adds missing filters by error rate in build consensus (fixes report) v3.1.9: Loosens mask primers after assemble pairs to use 0.4 error rate v.3.2.0: Annotations and formal workflow parameters to comport with current best practices",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vgX5nABDM17IfgmQZkBP63FvyvqQTUDT/view?usp=sharing

Bristol workflow to get sorted unique proper pair mapped reads,"This experimental workflow was designed for rna seq analysis of paired end reads. It creates a set of reads that are sorted, unique and mapped in a proper pair. This generates more mapped unique reads than setting tophat to only report unique hits.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KZJYA0ZOUE4vpA9h8YW1lr7zkDVCI7vO/view?usp=sharing
